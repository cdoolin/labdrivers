Labdrivers
----------

A collection of python scripts to help run experiments.  Written for use in the Davis lab at the University of Alberta.

To use, install with pip.  An editable install is recommended so changes to the labdrivers module are automatically used by python without having to reinstall the module.  Do this with

pip install -e .

or the path to the labdrivers directory instead of "." if running from another directory.
